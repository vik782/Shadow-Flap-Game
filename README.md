# Shadow Flap Game

Inspired by the infamous Flappy Bird Game, this is the knock-off version "Shadow Flap" that I built using **Java** as part of my course (SWEN20003) at the Univeristy of Melbourne. Flappy Bird is a mobile game where you, as the player controls a bird by tapping the screen to fly between pairs of pipes to score points.

## Gameplay
Shadow Flap takes the classic flappy bird formula and cranks it up with exciting twists and surprises:
- **Two Levels!** Start your flight in Level 0 and aim to score 10 points to unlock the real challenge: Level 1. The further you flap, the more intense it gets!
- **Lifebars Are In!** No more one-hit knockouts! In Level 0, you’ve got 3 lives to stay in the game. Make it to Level 1 and your resilience doubles — a whopping 10 lives to push through the chaos!
- **Weaponized Birds?!** That’s right — in Level 1, your feathery friend is no longer defenseless!
  - Pick up a _rock_ to smash through pesky green pipes.
  - Grab a _bomb_ to obliterate fiery steel pipes that shoot flames!

It's not just about dodging anymore — it's about flapping with style and firepower.
